## Replace System YouTube

**Magisk Module**<br>
_Simple module that will replace system installed YouTube_

### About
This module was written to remove the system YouTube Music that comes with Google's Android 13.
_YouTube Music v5.04.51 is the version packaged in Android 13_

This is done by using Magisk to overlay the files in _/system/product/app/YouTubeMusicPrebuilt/_ with zero byte files.
